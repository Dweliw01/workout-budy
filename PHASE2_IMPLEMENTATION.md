## **5. UI/UX Considerations**

### WorkoutScreen UX Flow:
1. User sees first exercise
2. Fills in weight/reps for set 1
3. Marks set complete â†’ rest timer starts
4. After rest, do set 2
5. Repeat for all sets
6. Hit "Next Exercise"

8. Hit "Finish Workout" â†’ see stats
9. Return to Home

### Key UX Features:
- Auto-save progress (so app crash doesn't lose data)
- Easy number input (numeric keyboard)
- Clear visual feedback (completed vs pending)
- Rest timer with sound/vibration (optional)
- Ability to go back/edit previous exercises
